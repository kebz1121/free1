				Archery is the practice or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows.<br><br>
				Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat and was invented in the late Palaeolithic or early Mesolithic periods. The oldest signs of archeryâ€™s use in Europe date from around 10,000BC, while in Asia and the Middle East evidence suggests archery originated even earlier. In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity.<br><br>
				As a sport, archery requires skills of precision, control, focus, repetition and determination. It is available to be practised by all, no matter age, gender or ability, and is a widespread pastime in both developed and developing countries.<br><br>
				But for me archery is not just a sport. Its my way of releasing stress and all. I find happiness in archery everytime I dry fire the arrows. The feeling that everytime I reload an arrow,  its just Im reloading the pain or hardships I have in life and focusing  and readying to  fire it away.
